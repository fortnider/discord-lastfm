# discord-lastfm
Updates discord rich presence based on your current lastfm playing song

SELF BOTTING IS BANNABLE AND AGAINST DISCORD TOS!!! use at your own risk



in a .env file:

DISCORD_TOKEN= your token

LAST_FM_API_KEY= your last fm api key

LAST_FM_USER= your last fm user name

todo:
gui and album art somehow
album art is probably far fetched. if anyone knows how to add an attachment to the activity without using rpc hit me up on discord
func#8900

plainly obvious to see, but this code is held together with only dreams and duct tape.

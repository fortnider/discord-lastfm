# discord-lastfm
Updates discord rich presence based on your current lastfm playing song

SELF BOTTING IS BANNABLE AND AGAINST DISCORD TOS!!! use at your own risk

in your default config folder make a new folder called discord-lfm, and in that make a file named config.toml

e.g. on linux: ~/.config/discord_lfm/config.toml

on mac: /Users/username/Library/Application Support/discord_lfm/config.toml

on winbows: C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\discord_lfm\config.toml

in the config file specify:

lfm_api_key = "your last fm api key"

lfm_user = "your lastfm username"

discord_token = " your discord token"



i am ABANDONING this project due to discord CUCKING me and SOFTBANNING my discord account from making API REQUESTS. 
alas it is my fault, i should have heeded my own warning. 
woe is me.
